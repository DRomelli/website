abstract: "We investigate the role of financial frictions in R&D spending in a large sample of European firms. Our identification strategy exploits the contraction in credit supply that followed the 2008â€“09 global financial crisis and 2012 Euro area sovereign debt crisis, together with differences in financial frictions across firms and industries to identify a causal effect of financial constraints on investment in innovation. We show that firms that are more likely financially constrained, in industries more dependent on external finance, invest disproportionally less in R&D during periods of tight credit supply. Smaller, private firms with weaker balance sheets also have a lower share of R&D in total investment, suggesting R&D drops more than total investment during these crisis episodes. These results are robust to different proxies of financial constraints and fixed-effects identification strategies."
