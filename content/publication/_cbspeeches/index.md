abstract: 'We study climate-related central bank communication using a novel dataset containing 35,487 speeches delivered by 131 central banks from 1986 to 2023.
We employ natural language processing techniques to identify and trace the evolution of key climate-related narratives centred around (i) green finance, and (ii) climate-related financial risks.
We find that central bank public communication strategies are primarily driven by underlying institutional factors, rather than exposure to climate-related risks. 
We then study the impact of climate-related communication on financial market dynamics through both a portfolio and a firm-level analysis. We find that equity returns of green firms outperform those of dirty firms when central banks engage more frequently and intensely with climate-related topics.'
