abstract: "This paper focuses on an early unique experiment of freely floating State-issued money, implemented in Venice between 1619 and 1666. Building on a new hand-collected database from a previously unexplored archival source, we show that, despite the Venetian ducat’s status as an international currency and the government’s reputation for fiscal prudence, its external value was significantly, and increasingly, affected by episodes of automatic government deficit monetization through the Banco del Giro during the crises of 1630 (outbreak of the bubonic plague) and 1648-50 (escalation of the Cretan War). This suggests that the institutional context plays an important role in the transmission mechanism between government deficit monetization and exchange rates."

abstract_short: "This paper examines the impact of government deficit monetization on the external value of Venetian ducats during crises in the 17th century. Despite Venice's reputation for fiscal prudence, the ducat's value declined due to monetary policies during the plague of 1630 and the Cretan War."
