abstract: "This paper discusses the evolution of central bank communication, focusing on recent efforts by central banks to engage with a wider audience via social media. We document the social media presence of major central banks and discuss how analyzing Twitter content by and about monetary policy makers can inform about the effectiveness of communication in influencing beliefs. We focus on recent techniques employed in analyzing social media content in order to understand how central bank communication affects expectations and, subsequently, behavior in financial markets."

abstract_short: "This paper examines the evolution of central bank communication, particularly their use of social media to reach wider audiences. It analyzes Twitter content related to monetary policy to assess how central bank communication impacts expectations and financial market behavior."
